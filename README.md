# Benvenuto-Pizzeria-DB-Management
This project showcases a comprehensive SQL database designed for Benvenuto's Pizzeria, focusing on efficient data management across orders, inventory, and staff. The database is structured with relational tables to capture essential business operations, including sales transactions, stock control, and employee scheduling. Custom SQL queries are crafted to retrieve and manipulate data, providing insights that support business decision-making. This project highlights my ability to design and implement a robust SQL database tailored to real-world scenarios.
